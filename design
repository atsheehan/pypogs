tick method:

decompose on game state
if single player, 
   if no piece is on the grid
      put the next piece on the grid
      generate a random next piece
   update drop tick counter
   if tick counter has hit the limit 
      reset counter to zero 
      drop the current piece by one row
      if the current piece collides with an existing brick
         attach it to the grid
if local multi-player, update drop tick counter for each player
if networked multi-player, check for new packets
